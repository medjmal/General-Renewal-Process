# General-Renewal-Process
Implement the General Renewal Process to determine the parameters of a repairable system's model. 
Repairable systems receive repair/maintenance actions that restore system components when they fail.
Following the process descirbed in this article [https://www.weibull.com/pubs/2005rm_07B_03.pdf](url), I implemented the process of estimating the parameters of a repairable system's model using the likelihood function of a KAJIMA model II.
